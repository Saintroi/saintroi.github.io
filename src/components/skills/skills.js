              I'm a young software developer, I don't pretend to know everything there is to know about it, but I do feel that
              I have been lucky enough to do a lot of real development work that directly affected applications and people,
              not just debugging someone else's code. So even though I spend a lot of time googling, I am comfortable getting things done.
              My experience is all over the place, but I feel the most alive in back-end development and scripting work.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
      </section>
